## Description

ARI is an interface available on Asterisk 11+ that lets you write applications
that run externally and control call flow through REST calls while receiving
events on a websocket.

In order to support different versions of the API, what we do is we maintain concrete implementations
for each version of the API, but we also have general interfaces that are used to work with objects
across different versions.

### Getting started

Simply add the library and an SLF4J logger to your package config, here is an example using Gradle
```
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.ari4java:ari4java:+'
    implementation 'ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:1.2.10'
}
```

Due to the sun setting of JCenter the jar is now publish through Sonatype to Maven Central but under a new groupId.
The groupId is now `io.github.ari4java` make sure you update your build files if you used `ch.loway.oss.ari4java`.
